## General info
Simple CRM system for a company. 

I add some frontend text content in Polish. Project is still in progress so I'll be adding a new functionality and of course some of frontend code.


## Screenshots


## Technologies
* Tech 1 - Symfony 5.0.7
* Tech 2 - PHP 7.3.10
* Tech 3 - HTML/CSS/JavaScript
* Tech 4 - Bootstrap 4 

## Setup

* Clone or download repository and unpack it (if you're going to use XAMPP move it into htdocs inside XAMPP installation directory)
* Open terminal and go into project directory
 * Start your local server, for example Apache with XAMPP, and switch on MySQL server as well. You can use Symfony server instead by executing command:
	  * php -S 127.0.0.1:8000 -t public
* Ececute commands:
	* composer install
	* yarn install
	* yarn add --dev @symfony/webpack-encore
	* yarn add webpack-notifier --dev
	* yarn encore dev
* Type localhost/crm-master/public/index.php/ in your browser (*crm-master* is default project name)


I wrote this instruction on my computer where I have already installed PHP and setted global path, so probably it will be necessery. If you use password to phpmyadmin you'll have to add it into .env file. 

If you'll have any issues with setup sorry for that, I wrote it from my mind, didn't check it on different machine.
